The Gorilla Game is a two-player projectile game developed for the Silicon Labs C8051F020
microcontroller interfaced with an S12864N graphical LCD module. Players control gorillas
placed atop randomly generated buildings and take turns launching bananas at each other's
gorillas. Potentiometers adjust launch angles and velocities, introducing strategic complexity
through physics-based projectile motion influenced by gravity and wind. Audio and visual
feedback enhance gameplay experience significantly.
